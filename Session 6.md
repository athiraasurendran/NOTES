Python Data Types

1) Numeric Type
   * Interger (int) - Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
     Eg: X = 10
   * Float (float) - Represents real numbers with decimal point.
     Eg: Y = 20.5
   * Complex (complext) - Represents numbers in the form a + bj , where a and b are floats, and j is the imaginary unit.
     Eg: Z = 1 + zj
2) Text Type
   * String (str) - Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.
     Eg: text = "Hello, World!"
3) Sequence Type
   * List (list) - An ordered, mutable collection of items. Items can be of different types.
     Eg: my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]
   * Tuple (tuple) - An ordered, immutable collection of items. Items can be of different types.
     Eg: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")
   * Range (range) - Represents an immutable sequence of numbers commonly used for looping.
     Eg: my_range = range (1, 10)
4) Mapping Type
   * Dictionary (dict) - An unordered collection of key value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable.
     Eg: my_dict = {"name":"Athira", "age"}
5) Set Type
   * Set (set) - An unordred collection of unique items.
     my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   * Frozen set (frozenset) - An immutable version of a set.
     Eg: my_frozenset = frozenset ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
6) Boolean
   * Boolean (bool) - Represents truth values. Can be either True or False.
     Eg: is_vaild = True
7) None Type
   * None Type (None) - Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
     result = None
